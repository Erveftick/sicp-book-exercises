# sicp-book-exercises

Project where I store my exercises solutions of 
[SICP](https://newstar.rinet.ru/~goga/sicp/sicp.pdf) book.
This repository uses Clojure as main programming
language instead of Schema, that described in the book.
Sometimes different functions might have different names
but in comment section under each task I leave an
explanation, what I changed, why I use this instead of
that and what I found useful outside the book.

## Check solutions

You need to use REPL for starting the project and evaluate
function in comment section of every task described in this
repo.

I used Intellij IDEA Repl (Cursive), you can use whatever
you want


## Graphs

For some tasks I wanted to show the result using graphs or
another diagram. For this I used [oz](https://github.com/metasoarous/oz)
library. In the comment section I give you commands for
starting this if you need it.
